 ######this code is my fisrt of such a length. 
 #####the thing i love about the code:
 I developed a method to call instead of searching the variable that stores the information of a car and when the car number is given to it it will directly arrive at the variable of array that contains the information of it and generate required outputs.
It was a manipulation of perls $ and @ symbol which generates a strign or an array respectively. So when we put $ before any string it turns out to be a variable that can store a string. so using $ (input by the user) should cause a variable calling. trying it on the actual code it turned out to be miracle and saved me of many for loops and my code of time. 

nice memories :)
